# Karpov.Courses

Hello!

This repository contains files with the tasks I completed as part of the course of Data Analysis by Karpov.Courses.

Here you can see and evaluate my progress, my ability to analyze data and the correctness of code.

Periodically I update them and supplement them with new completed tasks and projects.

Thank you!

Regards,
Nikita Korotkov (MazzDi)
